## A simple toturial for github settings
- Please go to Github.com to sign up individual accounts. Prof. Pei will add individual accounts to the contributor list.
- Github is a good platform for collaborative coding. Everyone should learn how to use that.
- Use `git clone` to clone the repo to the local disk

- Five commands are enough
	- `git clone`
	Copy repo to local file
	- `git add`
	Add new files online, but not take effect at the moment
	- `git commit -m 'Commit Message'`
	Add commitments to the files added after previous commitment
